## FAQ about Web Scraping Tool
1. What is a web scraping tool?

A web scraping tool is software that automates data extraction from websites. It collects and structures web data for various uses, such as market research, price tracking, and lead generation.

2. [Is web scraping legal?](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/blog/is-web-scraping-legal)

Web scraping legality depends on the website’s terms of service and the type of data being scraped. Scraping publicly available data is usually legal, but scraping personal or copyrighted information without permission may violate laws like GDPR, CCPA, or DMCA.

3. Do I need programming skills to use a web scraping tool?

Not necessarily. Many no-code web scraping tools (e.g., Scrapeless, WebHarvy, ParseHub) allow users to scrape data with point-and-click interfaces. However, advanced tools like Scrapy or BeautifulSoup require coding skills.

4. What is the difference between browser-based and browserless web scraping?

- Browser-based scraping (e.g., Selenium, Puppeteer) loads entire web pages, mimicking human browsing.
- [Browserless scraping](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/blog/ai-agents-with-browserless?utm_source=official&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=webscrapingtool) (e.g., Scrapeless) extracts data without loading a full browser, making it faster, more efficient, and harder to detect.
